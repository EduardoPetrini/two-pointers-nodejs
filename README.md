# Repository for two-sum and three-sum
The two pointers approach solves several algorithms problems. 

Two-sum and three-sum are very common algorithms problems in Computer Science solved by two pointers approach.
This repository implements solutions for both problems using two pointers.

## install
Just run `npm install` to install the nodejs dependencies

## run
It is possible to run the function directly by executing the following command:

`node two-sum 1,2,3,4 5`

where `1,2,3,4,5` is the string array and `5` is the target sum.

## jest
For automated test there is `jest` already configured.

`npm test`
